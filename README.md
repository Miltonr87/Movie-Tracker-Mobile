### About

Made with React and **Mobile First techniques**, the Web APP consumes an API provided by [MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). All movies are listed on the line below the search bar according to a search made in the **MovieDB database**. This application was used to learn how to manipulate the JSON data array provided by the API and convert it into a visual model with images, note and description. To build it I used the most modern tool in React documentation called **Hooks API**. 

### Getting Started

- Clone the repo (HTTP Protocol): ```git clone https://github.com/Miltonr87/Movie-Tracker-Mobile.git```
- Using NPM or Yarn to install the React APP and run the project on your computer. 

### Required:

As you see, **Movie Tracker Mobile** runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed with NPM or Yarn. Once you have Node installed, you will need the React (17.01) library. So, to start the project in your machine, open your terminal inside the Movie Tracker Mobile folder and type "NPM Install" or "Yarn Install".
